checkniner
==========

This application provides a database for tracking pilot-airstrip-aircraft
checkout tuples. Once recorded the tuples can be searched to find available
flight scheduling assignments based on the known parameters or to identify
checkouts which should be prioritized for new training to alleviate scheduling
constraints. A reporting feature allows analyzing checkouts per pilot, per
airstrip, or per base of operations.

### Built With

Checkniner stands on the shoulders of many incredible free & libre software
giants. Among them are several particularly valuable projects which have made
this application possible:

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
- [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)

Development Setup
-----------------

The only firm requirement for developing and testing `checkniner` is an
installation of Python 3.7+. The steps below will also assume the presence
of `git`, `virtualenv`, and `pip`.

First let's get the repository and set up the virtual environment.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/eallrich/checkniner.git
$ cd checkniner
$ virtualenv --python=python3 .
```

Next we'll provide a few dev [settings](cotracker/cotracker/settings) and install the python dependencies.

```shell
$ echo "export DATABASE_URL='sqlite://$(pwd)/cotracker/dev.db'"       >> bin/activate
$ echo "export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=cotracker.settings.development" >> bin/activate
$ echo "export PYTHONPATH='$(pwd)/cotracker/'"                        >> bin/activate
$ echo "export SECRET_KEY='$(head -c 15 /dev/urandom | base64)'"      >> bin/activate
$ echo "export SENTRY_DSN=https://key@sentry.io/2"                    >> bin/activate
$ echo "export EXPORT_PREFIX=zyxwvutsr"                               >> bin/activate
$ source bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements/development.txt
```

Then we have a bit of database set up work.

```shell
$ python cotracker/manage.py migrate --noinput
```

Finally we're ready to run our application!

```shell
$ honcho start
```

### Testing ###

```shell
# Run the tests using the provided script
$ scripts/test
# If desired, generate a visual HTML report of the coverage
$ cd cotracker
$ coverage html --include="./*"
```

Up and Running for Production
-----------------------------

Unlike setting up for development, deploying a production-ready instance is
intended to be as automated as practical. You'll only need to provide:

- A fresh Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit server
- A domain name pointing to the server's IP address
- A [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) DSN
- A secret key to restrict access to exported files

If you have SSH access to the server you can use `scripts/remote_init` to take
care of everything. Otherwise you'll need to connect to the server and do a few
things yourself before picking up with `scripts/setup` - just follow what's in
`scripts/remote_init` and perform those steps manually on your server.

We're going to assume these values for the above requirements:

- `DOMAIN`: `checkouts.example.com`
- `SENTRY_DSN`: `https://key@sentry.io/1`
- `EXPORT_PREFIX`: `zyxwvutsr`

You can read more about these settings (and the others the app supports) in
the [settings documentation](cotracker/cotracker/settings).

The simplest option is to check out this repository locally and then run the
`scripts/remote_init` script. Let's say the server's SSH connection string is
`root@10.31.41.59` and that you've set up SSH keys.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/eallrich/checkniner.git
$ checkniner/scripts/remote_init root@10.31.41.59 checkouts.example.com https://key@sentry.io/1 zyxwvutsr
```

After waiting approximately five minutes you should be able to visit your new
instance at https://checkouts.example.com/ and be presented with the login
screen.

### Backups and Restores ###

Details for backing up and restoring the checkniner database are available in
the [scripts/backups readme](scripts/backups).

### Sending Emails ###

The pilot weights feature supports the ability to send notification emails
when a weight value is modified. Sending email is currently accomplished
through the [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com/) API. To enable these email
notifications set the following:

```shell
$ echo "export MAILGUN_SENDER=\"Checkniner <mailgun@example.com>\"" >> bin/activate
$ echo "export MAILGUN_API_URL=https://api.mailgun.net/v3/example.com/messages" >> bin/activate
$ echo "export MAILGUN_API_KEY=key-0123456789abcdef" >> bin/activate
$ echo "export NOTIFY_WEIGHT_TO=receiver@example.com" >> bin/activate
# Optional additional recipients
$ echo "export NOTIFY_WEIGHT_CC=carbon@example.com" >> bin/activate
$ echo "export NOTIFY_WEIGHT_BCC=quiet@example.com" >> bin/activate
```
